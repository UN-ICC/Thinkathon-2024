[Challenge 1 - Digital Diplomacy](https://github.com/UN-ICC/Thinkathon-2024/tree/main/Challenge%20Prompt%201%20-%20Digital%20Diplomacy)

**Context**

As social and economic life becomes increasingly digitalized, it is critical that Digital Diplomacy tools and capabilities are 
strategically enhanced, prioritized, and matured. This will assist both international organizations and Member States in 
pursuing their policy goals, fostering multilateralism, and collaborating effectively to achieve the 2030 Development Agenda, 
including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

**Prompt**
 
Ideate a digital solution that can facilitate Digital Diplomacy. For example, technology can support diplomatic conferences, negotiations, decision-making, consular services or collaboration between multiple stakeholders inside and outside the diplomatic community, as well as by supporting both virtual and hybrid engagements. Consider mobile technologies, AI-powered tools, technical interfaces, process automation or any other digital technology that can fit this purpose. Reflect on how digital technology can advance the multilateral agenda and bolster resilience, ensuring seamless international and regional communication and cooperation. 
Since UNICC is one of the main contributors to the digitalization of the UN system, think about how to incorporate the Organization’s assets and work into your solution.

**Constraints**

- Trust and credibility in digital environments.
- Linguistic challenges.
- Uneven access to the internet worldwide.
- A variety of platforms across different UN agencies or Member States.
- Diplomatic rules and procedures.

[Challenge 2 - Quality Education](https://github.com/UN-ICC/Thinkathon-2024/tree/main/Challenge%20Prompt%202%20-%20Quality%20Education)

**Context**

Technology can help transform education and create new opportunities for students, educators and institutions. For example,
blockchain technologies and digital contracts can improve the accessibility and accountability of learning certificates by
enabling “digital credentials”. This can make education processes more efficient and paperless, increase quality assurance
through instant verification, make learning certificates more accessible and portable, and boost interoperability across
borders.

**Prompt**

Ideate a solution for digital credentials which ensures the trustworthiness of data, interoperability of systems, and
compliance with learning standards.
Since UNICC has the advantage of providing digital infrastructure, such as private cloud services through UNICC Cloud,
think about how to incorporate UNICC’s assets and work into your solution.

**Challenge**

- Legitimate issuing,storage and verification process for digital certificates.
- Identity and record management.
- Secure data management.
- Uneven access to high-quality education worldwide
